# Exercise Title

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

 - List the learning objectives for this exercise from your process document

## Part One

Give a one sentence explanation of context for what we're about to do in this part

1.  Give imperitive instructions of what to do.

    ```bash
    here's a code block
    notice the indenting by 4 spaces
    ```

2.  Use as many steps as you like; make sure to give regular opportunities to confirm students are on the right track, with expected output, sanity checks etc.

    ![myfig](../images/fig.png)/

    Notice the figure formatting:
    - image lives in the ../images folder relative to this file
    - no, the trailing `/` is not a typo - it's there to force latex to behave when we spin this in to a PDF for folks who like PDFs.

## Part 3

## Conclusion

In addition to summarizing the exercise, this is your opportunity to provide some broader context for what just happened; what are some topics for further study? Where does this fit into the bigger picture of the story we're telling in this workshop?
