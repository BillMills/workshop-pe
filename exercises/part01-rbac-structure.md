# Create a simple RBAC structure

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

 - Create a simple RBAC structure within UCP
 - Understand the relations between Organisations, Teams and Users

## Part 1

The Client Bundle can be downloaded by logging into your UCP user account.

1. Log into your UCP installation with an admin user, e.g. `admin`

![rbac01](../images/rbac01.png)/

2. Select your `Access Control` and `Orgs & Teams`

![rbac02](../images/rbac02.png)/

3. Select the `Create`Button and create the following Teams:

- developers

- devops

The result should reflect this:
![rbac03](../images/rbac03.png)/

1.  Give imperitive instructions of what to do.

    ```bash
    here's a code block
    notice the indenting by 4 spaces
    ```

2.  Use as many steps as you like; make sure to give regular opportunities to confirm students are on the right track, with expected output, sanity checks etc.

    ![myfig](../images/fig.png)/

    Notice the figure formatting:
    - image lives in the ../images folder relative to this file
    - no, the trailing `/` is not a typo - it's there to force latex to behave when we spin this in to a PDF for folks who like PDFs.

## Conclusion

In addition to summarizing the exercise, this is your opportunity to provide some broader context for what just happened; what are some topics for further study? Where does this fit into the bigger picture of the story we're telling in this workshop?
